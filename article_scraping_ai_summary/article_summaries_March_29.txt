Summary:
BALTIMORE — A crane appeared at the site of a collapsed highway bridge in Baltimore as crews prepared Friday to begin clearing wreckage that has stymied the search for four missing workers and blocked ships from entering or leaving the city's vital port.

A crane that can lift 1,000 tons — described as the largest on the Eastern Seaboard — had been expected to arrive late Thursday, and a second that can lift 400 tons should arrive Saturday, officials said earlier. They will be used to clear the channel of the twisted metal and concrete remnants of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, as well as the cargo ship that hit it this week.

Summary:
EDEN, Weber County — Powder Mountain majority owner Reed Hastings announced Friday the resort is adding over 3,000 acres of public and private terrain through a new ski lift and a land acquisition. It's the latest investment announced since the Netflix co-founder took over majority control of the resort last year.

About 900 acres of public terrain, including new access to expert and advanced terrain, are expected to become available through a lift expansion on land the resort already owns in Wolf Canyon, also referred to as DMI. The measure is also expected to add close to 150 acres of additional terrain that will be available for hiking.

Resort officials said they plan to add more "wide-open" bowls, prime glades and expert shoots in this area, but it's not quite clear yet when the new terrain will be available. Surveying and planning are expected to begin this summer and construction of the new lift could start in the summer of 2025.

Summary:
PROVO — When Arthur Brooks' three kids turned 18, they each handed over a business plan to him. But not the kind of plan you might think. It was a business plan for their lives.

"They are startup founders of themselves, incorporated," Brooks said. "That's their firm. They're the founding CEO. Now, the currency of their life is not money. It's love and happiness."

Brooks, a Harvard Kennedy School professor and columnist for The Atlantic, intended for this plan to help his children answer two questions — questions he believed that if they could answer, they would be on their way toward happiness. And before an overflowing audience at Brigham Young University on Thursday, he asked those very questions and unveiled what he described as the most important strategies to find happiness.

Summary:
WASHINGTON — Utah Sen. Mitt Romney is calling for the creation of a new oversight committee to expand the efforts Congress made to go after the fraudulent use of federal COVID-19 funds.

Romney, a Republican, and Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, a Democrat and the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, have introduced bipartisan legislation creating a new Government Spending Oversight Committee.

The new committee is seen as a successor to the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee responsible for overseeing some $5 trillion in pandemic-related programs and spending that's set to be terminated next year. The committee established in 2020 is credited with helping to uncover an estimated $1.95 billion to date in fraud losses.

Summary:
NEW YORK — When No Labels' critics got the loudest, it was Joe Lieberman who came to the group's defense.

The former Connecticut senator was a founding chairman of the centrist organization that focused, above all, on promoting bipartisanship in national politics. Despite its benign stated mission, No Labels inflamed many people across politics by working to recruit a third-party presidential candidate that some fear might tilt the 2024 election in former President Donald Trump's favor.

At almost every major turn, Lieberman served as the group's chief public defender. He was also a private force in No Labels' presidential recruitment push. He insisted repeatedly in interviews, as recently as last week, that the nation is craving an alternative to Trump and President Joe Biden.
