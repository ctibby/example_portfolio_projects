Summary:
As the cost of higher education continues to climb, questions surrounding the value of a college degree have become increasingly prominent. The benefits of pursuing post-secondary education and concerns regarding affordability and student loan debt should be important considerations for all students.

A comprehensive study commissioned by the Utah System of Higher Education (USHE), emphasized the significant financial benefits associated with post-secondary education attainment. According to the report conducted by Cicero Higher Ed, individuals with a degree in Utah experience substantially higher levels of income and job stability compared to their non-degree counterparts.

Key findings from the report indicate that the average annual compensation for degree holders remains approximately double that of individuals without a degree. Moreover, those with post-secondary credentials are less likely to face long-term unemployment, underscoring higher education's enduring value in today's competitive job market.

SALT LAKE CITY — Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, will give the commencement address for the Johns Hopkins University class of 2024 in Baltimore on May 23, the school announced Thursday.

"Democracy means we need to be able to work together," said Romney, who announced last year he would not seek reelection. "Graduates from our great universities like Johns Hopkins can make a difference."

Summary:
SALT LAKE CITY — Lauri Markkanen entered a dimly lit room and his eyes grew wide. There were engraved mugs, detailed maps, wizard's chess pieces, Quidditch jerseys — all the things that had once only filled his imagination were right in front of him.

He wanted the lot.

After all, he had just finished walking through Hogwarts (or the closest we mere muggles can get to walking through Hogwarts); he'd seen pictures talk and move, looked through magical classrooms, and even got a taste of how it felt to fly.

Summary:
SALT LAKE CITY — In a nondescript brick building that used to house the University of Utah's law school library, interdisciplinary teams of students in the university's games programs are huddled in groups working toward an approaching deadline to complete video games that will launch at a public event on campus on April 24.

Students develop every aspect of the games from initial pitches to their launch, which Michael Young, chairman of the university's top-ranked Games Division, likens to the first night of a theatrical production.

"It's really remarkable for our students, because many of them have never seen people play the game that they're making. It's like opening night for a play when you go up on stage and people gasp or react, and you can hear them in the audience," Young said.

Summary:
PROVO — Signs of how the BYU football quarterback competition will ultimately unfold are being provided as Kalani Sitake's team heads into the final stretch of its spring practice session.

Sitake addressed the media just prior to last Friday's BYU Alumni flag football game, breaking down what he's observed of the quarterback competition between Jake Retzlaff (6-1, 205, Jr.) and Gerry Bohanaon (6-3, 225, Sr.) thus far.

"I think they're really neck-and-neck," Sitake said. "Jake is a lot more comfortable, but Gerry is starting to make a lot more strides with his comfort level with the offense. So we can't make that decision today or tomorrow, but maybe next week when you guys talk to me. We'll see how it goes, but I really like the competition."

Summary:
I love trucks. My affection started on my grandpa's ranch with a 1940s-era flatbed that I drove through the hayfield. I was too small to throw the bales on the back, so it made sense to have the 10-year-old kid drive.

In all the years since, my passion for trucks remained rooted in the work chores trucks allowed one to accomplish. From hauling rocks or firewood to pulling out stumps, my trucks get used for truck purposes.

So when I recently got the opportunity to test drive a 2024 Ford F-350 Super Duty, it was almost like Christmas morning. And I am not the only one who likes big, powerful trucks. J.D. Power selected the current F-350 as its Best Large Heavy Duty Pickup of 2024

LOS ANGELES — Louis Gossett Jr., the first Black man to win a supporting actor Oscar and an Emmy winner for his role in the seminal TV miniseries "Roots," has died. He was 87.

Gossett's nephew told the Associated Press that the actor died Thursday night in Santa Monica, California. No cause of death was revealed.

Gossett always thought of his early career as a reverse Cinderella story, with success finding him from an early age and propelling him forward, toward his Academy Award for "An Officer and a Gentleman."
