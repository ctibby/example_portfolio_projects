Summary:
WASHINGTON — Speaker Mike Johnson will delay sending the House's articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to the Senate this week as previously planned after Republican senators requested more time Tuesday to build support for holding a full trial.

The sudden change of plans cast fresh doubts on the proceedings, the historic first impeachment of a Cabinet secretary in roughly 150 years. Seeking to rebuke the Biden administration's handling of the southern border, House Republicans impeached Mayorkas in February, but delayed sending the articles while they finished work on government funding legislation.

Johnson had planned to send the impeachment charges to the Senate on Wednesday evening. But as it became clear that Democrats, who hold majority control of the chamber, had the votes to quickly dismiss them, Senate Republicans requested that Johnson delay until next week. They hoped the tactic would prolong the process.

Summary:
Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have one thing in common throughout the globe: reading the scriptures. Most members of the Church own a personal set of scriptures to read and study from. Throughout the years, scripture sets have been available in many forms and styles including print, digital and audio.

But in 2019 — as they sought to simplify and standardize the options — the Church discontinued all colors and styles of scriptures other than black. While this aligned with recent efforts to support a global faith, many missed the variety.

In an effort to fill this void and help members fall in love with their physical scriptures all over again, one Utah company is making bright, colorful scriptures for those who want to create a treasured keepsake.

Summary:
SALT LAKE CITY— The delegation from the Switzerland-based International Olympic Committee that's headed to Utah this week to tour proposed venues for a 2034 Winter Games will be in France later this month to do the same for that country's 2030 Winter Games bid.

The International Olympic Committee announced Monday that its members who serve on the Future Host Commission, along with executives and staff, will visit the French Alps and other locations in France April 22-26 that would be used for a Winter Games, "to provide a deep dive into the proposal and the local context, with a view to election by the IOC Session in July."

Both bids already have been named preferred hosts by committee leaders — Salt Lake City-Utah, for 2034, and the French Alps, for 2030 — under the new, less formal selection process that, if all goes well, will end with the formal award of the two Olympics when the committee meets in Paris before the start of the 2024 Summer Games in the French capital.

Summary:
PONTIAC, Mich. — A judge sentenced the parents of a Michigan school shooter to at least 10 years in prison Tuesday for failing to take steps that could have prevented a "runaway train" — the killing of four students in 2021.

Jennifer and James Crumbley are the first parents convicted in a U.S. mass school shooting. They were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter after prosecutors presented evidence of an unsecured gun at home and indifference toward the teen's mental health.

Ethan Crumbley drew dark images of a gun, a bullet and a wounded man on a math assignment, accompanied by despondent phrases. Staff at Oxford High School did not demand that he go home but were surprised when the Crumbleys didn't volunteer it during a brief meeting.
