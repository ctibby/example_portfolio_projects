Summary:
DETROIT — In September, Hyundai and Kia issued a recall of 3.4 million of its vehicles in the United States with an ominous warning: The vehicles should be parked outdoors and away from buildings because they risked catching fire, whether the engines were on or off.

Six months later, most of those autos remain on the road — unrepaired — putting their owners, their families and potentially other people in danger of fires that could spread to garages, houses or other vehicles.

Hyundai and Kia have acknowledged that there's little hope of repairing most of the affected vehicles until June or later, roughly nine months after they announced the recalls. (Hyundai owns part of Kia, though the two companies operate independently.)

Summary:
SALT LAKE CITY — Gina Zanik noticed something was off with her husband. He looked more fatigued, more slugging; his usual energy just wasn't there.

That was easy for Justin Zanik to explain away.

Of course he was tired, he thought when his wife brought it up. The Utah Jazz general manager had gone to the World Cup in Japan and the Philippines and then took another trip to Australia shortly after that. Fatigue comes with the job of running an NBA team. There's a reason he always had Red Bull in hand.

Summary:
SALT LAKE CITY— At least six Salt Lake County women share a disturbing reality: prosecutors believe they were intentionally hit by a man in a white car while they were walking outside.

KSL is aware of at least two other eerily similar hit-and-run incidents involving women and a suspect in a white car, but those remain under investigation.

On March 25, Salt Lake County prosecutors filed several felony charges – including six counts of attempted murder – against 26-year-old Anh Duy Pham. The charges represent four hit-and-run incidents investigators have linked to Pham and involve a total of six victims.

Summary:
NEW YORK — The theft of sensitive information belonging to millions of AT&T's current and former customers has been recently discovered online, the telecommunications giant said this weekend.

In a Saturday announcement addressing the data breach, AT&T said that a dataset found on the "dark web" contains information including some Social Security numbers and passcodes for about 7.6 million current account holders and 65.4 million former account holders.

Whether the data "originated from AT&T or one of its vendors" is still unknown, the Dallas-based company noted — adding that it had launched an investigation into the incident. AT&T has also begun notifying customers whose personal information was compromised.

Summary:
SACRAMENTO — Brice Sensabaugh apparently just needed to see one go down.

Over the last 11 games, the Utah Jazz rookie had shot 11% from 3-point range. He hadn't been shy over the time (putting up 4.1 attempts per game) and, for the most part, they were shots that Will Hardy was just fine with him taking.

He just wasn't making most of them.

Summary:
POCATELLO, Idaho — A mother from Texas has been reunited with her children after a months-long separation at an east Idaho hospital.

Britnay Campbell-Martin was treated at Portneuf Medical Center for over four months while her 5-year-old and 1-year-old sons, Tabryis and Braylon, were at home in Texas City, Texas. On March 16, Campbell-Martin was reunited with her children after Dr. Fahim Rahim took up the task of getting her medical care transferred to her home.

"As first, I was a Debbie-downer thinking maybe I was going to die. But now that I'm home, I don't feel that way. I'm focused on staying here for my boys," Campbell-Martin said.

Summary:
CONSUMERS, Carbon County — A heartfelt dog rescue quickly became the center of a community's attention Friday, after a woman rescued a lost dog and realized shortly after making it to the vet that the situation was more dreadful than she knew.

The dog, now named BluJay, was found wandering near the ghost town of Consumers near Price and Helper. The rescuer, Tanner Tamllos, said in a Facebook post* that she'd taken him to the vet, and that he was found in poor condition.

"He is in terrible shape and has been out there for quite some time and looks as if he has been attacked by something," Tamllos wrote.

Summary:
SALT LAKE CITY — Plans to build new facilities to provide long-term medical care for veterans in Utah and Idaho have encountered significant barriers from the Department of Veterans Affairs, and a very patriotic piece of legislation.

The Build America, Buy America Act requires federally funded infrastructure projects to use construction materials and products manufactured in the U.S. It became effective for loans and grants in May of 2022, but some plans were caught in the transition, receiving approval for federal grants with a budget calculated before the act was passed, only to be told they will have comply to new regulations that increase project costs by millions or lose funding completely.

"BABAA, as a whole, is a great idea," said Mark Tschampl, Idaho's chief administrator for veteran services. But he said projects in his state are "dead in the water" unless the VA grants a waiver to those projects, exempting them from the rules that changed after their grants were submitted and approved.

Summary:
SALT LAKE CITY — Sociologists and other family experts often ponder a link between unmarried parenthood and poverty. They debate how family structure strengthens or weakens the chance that families will flourish or falter. And they discuss and write about the "success sequence," which says poverty is less likely if parents earn a high school diploma, work, get married and only then have children, to ensure the soundest footing for family stability.

The link between nonmarital births and family structure has been borne out by the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study, which has followed thousands of babies and their families since they were born in 75 hospitals in about 20 big cities across America between 1998 and 2000. Because disadvantaged families are often left out of studies for various reasons, the research project — a collaboration between Princeton and Columbia universities — has oversampled births to unmarried parents to fill that gap.

The result, after weighting the data, creates a portrait "representative of births in medium and large cities" during those years, Princeton's principal investigator, sociologist Kathryn J. Edin, told Deseret News. A noted poverty scholar, she also directs the Bendheim-Thoman Center for Research on Child Wellbeing at Princeton.
