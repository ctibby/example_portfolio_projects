Summary:
A class-action settlement by the National Association of Realtors (NAR) in March brings to light some changes for both home buyers and sellers in the real estate market. Fortunately for buyers and sellers in Utah, most of the required changes are already being done by local Realtors.

"The settlement isn't really what the media have portrayed it to be," said Dawn Stevens, president of the Salt Lake Board of Realtors. "The absence of a buyer's agent leaves the buyer to navigate an intricate process of drafting offers, negotiating repairs, and signing legal contracts. Conversely, homeowners seeking to bypass the buyer's agent commission might find themselves significantly reducing their asking price to attract buyers. It really is going to hurt buyers and sellers in the end."

Here are some things you need to know about the settlement:

Summary:
Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have one thing in common throughout the globe: reading the scriptures. Most members of the Church own a personal set of scriptures to read and study from. Throughout the years, scripture sets have been available in many forms and styles including print, digital and audio.

But in 2019 — as they sought to simplify and standardize the options — the Church discontinued all colors and styles of scriptures other than black. While this aligned with recent efforts to support a global faith, many missed the variety.

In an effort to fill this void and help members fall in love with their physical scriptures all over again, one Utah company is making bright, colorful scriptures for those who want to create a treasured keepsake.

Summary:
NEW YORK — Tesla has canceled the long-promised inexpensive car that investors have been counting on to drive its growth into a mass-market automaker, according to three sources familiar with the matter and company messages seen by Reuters.

The automaker will continue developing self-driving robotaxis on the same small-vehicle platform, the sources said.

The decision represents an abandonment of a long-standing goal that Tesla chief Elon Musk has often characterized as its primary mission: affordable electric cars for the masses. His first "master plan" for the company in 2006 called for manufacturing luxury models first, then using the profits to finance a "low-cost family car."

Summary:
WASHINGTON — NASA wants to come up with an out-of-this-world way to keep track of time, putting the moon on its own souped-up clock.

It's not quite a time zone like those on Earth, but an entire frame of time reference for the moon. Because there's less gravity on the moon, time there moves a tad quicker — 58.7 microseconds every day — compared to Earth. So the White House on Tuesday instructed NASA and other U.S agencies to work with international agencies to come up with a new moon-centric time reference system.

"An atomic clock on the moon will tick at a different rate than a clock on Earth," said Kevin Coggins, NASA's top communications and navigation official. "It makes sense that when you go to another body, like the moon or Mars, that each one gets its own heartbeat."
